             <div class="dropdown-content">
              <p>
                Our clients are looking for flexible and agile software development talents who can
                 support their organizations through all parts of the software development life cycle
                  and who are able to adapt and integrate seamlessly within their teams and enterprise.
                  Agile software development addresses software development methodologies focused on the
                   principle of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through 
                   collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. 
    
              </p>
    
              <p>
                Agile approaches emphasize a disciplined project management method that supports frequent
                 review and adjustment, a leadership philosophy that encourages teamwork, self-organization
                  and accountability, engineering best practices intended to allow for rapid delivery of 
                  high-quality software, and a business approach that aligns development with customer needs 
                  and company goals. 
    
              </p>
    
              <p>
                A central tenet in Agile development is that it allows teams to deliver value faster, with
                 greater quality and predictability, and flexibility to react to changes. Scrum and Kanban
                  are the most established Agile methodologies. An Agile development represents a process 
                  that is aligned to the goals of the Agile Manifesto. The Manifesto was established by 14 
                  thought leaders in the software industry, and exhibits their experience of what approaches
                   do and do not work for software development.
